    The module begins by raising questions such as what is art? What is design? What is beauty? What is good art ? what is not? The notion of value in art and so on. In the Western tradition, we cover concepts like ‘realism’ (Plato), ‘empiricism’ (Aristotle) and ‘sublimity’ (Longinus), and undertake a brief journey through various other theories leading to the post modern age. The questions of power and politics play a crucial role in the study of art and culture and the module will seek to familiarise students with such theories. We also look at theories of aesthetic perception in Classical India. For this, we will take recourse to the Rasa theory as espoused by Bharatamuni (Natyasastra). In the process, we try to explore the concept of bhavas, the process of generation of rasa, the essence of dramaturgy and poesie, etc.

    List of Assignments
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">
   <em>
    The assignments in this course provide the platform to understand the concepts in the perspective of different disciplines and their application potential. They also enable us to see the gaps between theory and practice as it applies to design. The assignments designed for the course will demand skills in understanding of abstract concepts and articulation of the same in visualisation through one’s senses and skills, speech and writing abilities. Please note that the assignments aim at gauging understanding of the issues taken up in the course as a whole rather than creative abilities. One end of the course written assignment in about 1500-2000 words that could be a reflection on any one of the topics covered in the course.
